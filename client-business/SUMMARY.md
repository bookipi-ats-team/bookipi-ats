## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Open browser
# http://localhost:5173
```

That's it! The app is running with mock data.

## 📖 Documentation

✅ **README.md** - Main documentation
✅ **QUICK_START.md** - Getting started guide
✅ **API_GUIDE.md** - API configuration details
✅ **SUMMARY.md** - This file!

## 🔄 Next Steps

### For Frontend Development
1. Open http://localhost:5173
2. Test all features with mock data
3. Customize mock data in `src/api/mockData.ts`
4. Tweak styles in `tailwind.config.js`

### For Backend Integration
1. Review backend requirements in README.md
2. Implement the REST API endpoints
3. Update `src/api/config.ts`:
   ```typescript
   USE_MOCK: false
   BASE_URL: 'your-backend-url'
   ```
4. Test with real data!

### For Deployment
1. Build production bundle:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
2. Deploy `/dist` folder to:
   - Vercel (recommended)
   - Netlify
   - Any static host

## 🎯 Testing Checklist

Try these features:

- [ ] Navigate to `/onboarding` and create a business
- [ ] Search for jobs on dashboard
- [ ] Filter jobs by status
- [ ] Create a new job with AI suggestions
- [ ] Generate a job description with AI
- [ ] View job summary page
- [ ] Open pipeline and drag applicants
- [ ] Click an applicant card to see details
- [ ] Add a note to an application
- [ ] Check match scores and CV scores

## 🎨 Customization Ideas

### Change Colors
Edit `tailwind.config.js`:
```js
colors: {
  primary: {
    DEFAULT: '#your-color',
    hover: '#your-hover-color',
  }
}
```

### Add More Mock Data
Edit `src/api/mockData.ts`:
```typescript
export const mockJobs: Job[] = [
  // Add your jobs here
];
```

### Add New Routes
Edit `src/App.tsx`:
```tsx
<Route path="/your-route" element={<YourPage />} />
```

## 🐛 Known Notes

- CSS linting shows warnings for `@tailwind` and `@apply` - **This is normal!** Tailwind processes these at build time.
- Mock mode persists data only in memory (resets on refresh)
- Drag-and-drop works best in Chrome

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **React Query DevTools** are enabled! Click the floating icon to inspect queries
2. **Mock delays** simulate real API - adjust in `src/api/index.ts`
3. **Layout component** shows "Mock Mode Active" indicator - update when live
4. **TypeScript** catches errors early - check the Problems panel

## 🤝 Team Collaboration

### For Backend Devs
- Share the API requirements from README.md
- Mock data shows expected response formats
- Test with Postman/curl before connecting frontend

### For Applicant Portal Devs
- Can share types from `src/types/index.ts`
- Similar patterns for API client setup
- Coordinate on shared backend endpoints
